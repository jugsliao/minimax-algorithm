AI Game Player
This code implements an AI player for a game with black and white pawns on a board. It utilizes the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to select the best move for the black player.

Features
Minimax Algorithm: The AI player uses the minimax algorithm to search through the game tree and evaluate different move possibilities. This algorithm ensures optimal decision-making by considering all possible moves and their consequences.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: To optimize the search process, alpha-beta pruning is employed. This technique eliminates unnecessary branches of the game tree, resulting in significant performance improvements without compromising the quality of the chosen move.
Heuristic Evaluation: The AI player employs a heuristic evaluation function to assess the desirability of a given board state. The evaluation considers various factors such as piece positions, their values, and defensive strategies to assign a score representing the potential advantage of the black player.
Efficient Move Generation: The code efficiently generates all valid moves for the black player by considering the current board state and available options. It prioritizes moves that are more likely to lead to favorable outcomes, optimizing the decision-making process.
Lookup Table Optimization: The evaluation scores of board states are cached in a lookup table to avoid redundant calculations. This optimization reduces computation time and enhances the overall performance of the AI player.
Usage
To utilize this AI player for your game, follow these steps:

Import the necessary utilities and define the game board.
Create an instance of the PlayerAI class.
Invoke the make_move function, passing the current board state as an argument.
Retrieve the recommended move, consisting of source and destination coordinates.
Apply the move to the game board and continue gameplay.
Customization
The code can be easily customized to suit specific game rules and requirements:

Game Rules: Modify the Board class methods to adhere to the rules of your game. Implement board initialization, move validation, and game over conditions based on the specific game mechanics.
Heuristic Evaluation: Adjust the heuristic evaluation function in the Board class to reflect the importance of different factors in your game. Consider the values of the game pieces, their positions, defensive strategies, and any additional rules specific to your game.
Search Depth: In the make_move function, you can adjust the search depth passed to the minimax function based on the complexity of your game. Increasing the depth allows for a more thorough evaluation of moves but may result in longer processing times.
Requirements
This code requires the following:

Python 3.x
utils.py module (provide the necessary game utility functions)
copy module (for deep copying the board state)
Conclusion
This AI game player showcases the implementation of a powerful AI algorithm, the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, to make intelligent decisions in a game with black and white pawns. The code is optimized for efficiency and provides a solid foundation for creating AI players for various board games. By leveraging this code, developers with an AI background can demonstrate their expertise in algorithmic decision-making, heuristic evaluation, and game tree search techniques to create impressive and intelligent game-playing agents.
